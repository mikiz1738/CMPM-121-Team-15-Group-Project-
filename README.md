## Tools and Materials
## 1. Our group has decided to use the phaser framework since we are most familiar with it through our experiences in CMPM 120 and CMPM 121. We believe that this framework is the most efficient way to create our game since it supports a diverse range of game genres and functionalities so that we don't have to develop those tools ourselves. Phaser also has a built in physics engine, which we believe will be useful as well. Furthermore, we also plan on using tween in order to support animation for sprites and other visual elements in our game.

## 2. The programming languages which we will be using are typescript, javascript, css, and html. We choose javascript and typescript because these are the langauges which our game framework supports. Html and css are used along with javascript and typescript to define the formatting and contents which are displayed on the web browser. Javascript and typescript were also chosen because it makes it easier when we have to alternate our platform choice.

## 3. For our project, we plan to use Adobe Photoshop for creating detailed visual assets and Aseprite for designing pixel art. Photoshop is ideal for creating high-quality textures, backgrounds, and other 2D elements due to its robust set of tools and layering tools, which make it versatile for different styles of digital art. Aseprite, on the other hand, is specifically tailored for pixel art and animations, making it perfect for crafting retro-style sprites and characters. These tools were chosen because they align with the artistic direction of our game, and we have various levels of familiarity with the tool. This combination ensures we can efficiently create assets while also developing our team's skills.

## 4. For our alternate platform, we plan to develop the game using Phaser but replace TypeScript with JavaScript as the primary programming language, alongside HTML and CSS for user interfaces and styling. This shift allows us to compare the advantages and trade-offs between TypeScript JavaScript. While TypeScript provides enhanced code safety and tooling benefits, JavaScript enables faster prototyping and broader accessibility for web-based deployment. By leveraging HTML and CSS, we can further enhance the user experience, tailoring the game interface for browser compatibility. By maintaining the same game framework across platforms, we can focus on exploring the impacts of language choices and front-end technologies on workflow, game performance, and overall development efficiency.

## Outlook
## Our team hopes to explore an unique game mechanic that sets us apart from other teams, focusing on an innovative interaction with the game world that may not be as commonly attempted. While the specifics are still evolving, we aim to create a mechanic that offers both strategic depth and simplicity, where players make meaningful decisions that impact the progression of the game. This could involve elements like resource management, spatial relationships, or time-based actions, all designed to provide a fresh gameplay experience. By focusing on a mechanic that is both approachable and engaging, we hope to offer something different that enhances the overall game experience while aligning with our team's goals of simplicity and efficiency.
## We anticipate that the most difficult aspect of this project is the sheer scale of it. Our group has very limited experience implementing and creating a game with so many elements as we have mostly been constrained to prototyping.
## We are hoping to learn more about implementing our ideas through our chosen framework, phaser, by building upon the knowledge and skills developed throughout CMPM 120 and CMPM 121. In addition, we hope to challenge ourselves outside of our comfort zone to transition from one language to another in an attempt to diversify our toolkits and help us to become more adaptable and flexible programmers.
